# Ski Club Games - Creative Resume

This project showcases a set of interactive web-based games inspired by **The New York Times Games** (Wordle, Connections, Mini Crossword, Strands), but with a focus on ski, snowboard, and university-related themes. The project is a part of a creative resume for my university's ski club.

## Games Included

1. **Wordle**: Guess the 5-letter ski or snowboard-related word.
2. **Connections**: Group ski and snowboard terms into related categories.
3. **Mini Crossword**: Solve a crossword puzzle with ski and university-themed clues.
4. **Strands**: Connect related ski/snowboard words by dragging and dropping.
